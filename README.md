# Toby

A WIP terminal-based observer for the Erlang VM. Just an early prototype here
so far.

It's being developed in parallel with [ex_termbox][1] and [Ratatouille][2],
which respectively provide termbox bindings and a terminal UI kit for Elixir /
Erlang.

## Running It

First, clone the repo and run `mix deps.get`. Then to run the application:

One way to find the $NODE@HOST is to connect a console to the process:

Erlang:
```bash
/opt/dog_trainer/bin/dog_trainer remote_console
```
The prompt with display:
```
($NODE@$HOST)1>
```

```bash
iex --sname $NODE@$HOST --erl "-setcookie $COOKIE" -S mix

or

iex --name $NODE@$HOST --erl "-setcookie $COOKIE" -S mix
```

The default configuration in config.exs only discovers nodes on the same host via epmd.  Other connections should be possiblewith a different libcluster config.


## Building a Release

It's also possible to create a distributable, self-contained executable via
Distillery. I'd like to provide these for download in the future, but for now
you can build one yourself using the provided config.

Releases built on a given architecture can generally be run on machines of the
same architecture.

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix release --executable --transient
```

See the output for the location of the built executable (most likely at
`_build/prod/rel/toby/bin/toby.run`).

This is a Distillery release that bundles the Erlang runtime and the toby
application. Start it in the foreground:

```bash
_build/prod/rel/toby/bin/toby.run foreground
```

You can also move this executable somewhere else (e.g., to a directory in your
$PATH). A current caveat is that it must be able to unpack itself, as Distillery
executables are self-extracting archives.

## Termbox NIFs & Comparison to Other Approaches

### How does this compare to other tools like observer_cli and etop?

These are nice tools written in pure Erlang, but I was looking for a user
experience closer to htop or terminal vim/emacs. Pure-Erlang tools cannot access
raw terminal events; they can only get line-buffered input (i.e., some
characters and then a return).

Because toby uses the termbox library (an alternative to ncurses) under the
hood, it can support interactions like scrolling with the keyboard or mouse,
clicking, or pressing a single key to perform an action. It also doesn't flicker
on updates, and it can respond to window resizes by automatically performing a
relayout of the content. These things unfortunately aren't possible in pure
Erlang, as it requires putting the terminal into "raw" mode. Toby relies on NIFs
from ex_termbox in order to do this.

### Isn't it dangerous to use NIFs?

Yes, it certainly is, but the idea isn't to run this in the same VM as your
production code.

Rather, it's to run toby as a separate, hidden node and simply connect it to
your node or cluster via Erlang distribution protocol. This is similar to how a
C node works. By running toby in a separate VM, even if one of the NIFs causes a
segfault in the observer node, it should not affect the node(s) being observed.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Implement views from observer on a basic level:
  * [x] System
  * [x] Load Charts
  * [ ] Memory Allocators
  * [x] Applications
  * [x] Processes
  * [x] Ports
  * [x] Tables
  * [x] Node information
* [ ] Support connecting to other nodes:
  * [x] Via the application UI
  * [ ] Via the CLI
* [ ] Actions on applications, ports, processes and tables.
* [ ] Tracing integration
